Core Coin Value Tracker
====
Execute using:
`getPrices(500, "5")`

Add a 3rd option to specify pings per hour (has to be at least one ping per hour)
Add a 4th option to specify % deviation - this is the % value of the base price +/- from the final price depending on the track. The final fluctuation value is random.

The returned result is
`{
  "1": [...],
  "2": [...], etc
}`
